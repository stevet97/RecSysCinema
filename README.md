# ðŸŽ¥ **CineMatch: A Movie Recommendation System Using RBM**

Welcome to **CineMatch**, a movie recommendation system powered by a **Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM)**! This project is built using the **MovieLens dataset** and aims to predict movie preferences for users based on their historical ratings.

---

## ðŸ“– **Overview**
CineMatch leverages the power of machine learning to analyze user-movie interactions and generate personalized movie recommendations. By using RBMs, the system learns hidden patterns in the data, enabling it to predict which movies a user might likeâ€”even for movies they've never rated before.

## ðŸš€ **Features**
- **Machine Learning with RBM**: Implements a Restricted Boltzmann Machine using PyTorch for efficient collaborative filtering.
- **Customizable**: Easy to adjust the number of hidden units, learning rate, and epochs for training.
- **Performance Tracking**: Evaluates the recommendation system using test loss (Mean Absolute Error).
- **Reproducible Setup**: Well-documented code and data for easy replication.
